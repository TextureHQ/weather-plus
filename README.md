# Weather Plus

DO NOT USE YET -- WIP STILL NOT FUNCTIONAL YET

An awesome TypeScript weather client for fetching weather data from various weather providers.

## What makes it "plus"?

* Support for various weather providers:
    * [National Weather Service](https://weather-gov.github.io/api/)
    * [Tomorrow](https://www.tomorrow.io/) (coming soon!)
    * [WeatherKit](https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/) (coming soon!)
* A clean and standardized API for fetching weather data regardless of the weather provider
* Baked in support for caching with [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* Built with TypeScript so it includes a type-safe API out of the box
